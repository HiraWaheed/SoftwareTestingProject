# SoftwareTestingProject
This project was made for my Software Testing course. It uses an Arabic database of hadith's and their narrators. It was developed using test-driven development and following the appropriate layering structure. This project mainly focused on doing testing of the code and developing effective test cases using different methods like  edge-pair coverage etc.
